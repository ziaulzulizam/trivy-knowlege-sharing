# Use Case 2: PHP Application Vulnerability Management Workflow

## Scenario: Complete PHP Application Security Pipeline
A developer creates a PHP application with vulnerable and outdated dependencies, containerizes it, and implements a comprehensive vulnerability management workflow with Trivy.

## Workflow Steps:
1. **Create Vulnerable PHP Application** - Set up application with outdated dependencies
2. **Build and Push Docker Image** - Containerize the application
3. **Comprehensive Trivy Vulnerability Assessment** - Initial scanning
4. **CVE Assessment and Prioritization** - Analyze and prioritize findings
5. **Generate Multiple Report Formats** - SARIF for GitHub, HTML for humans
6. **Automated Reporting Pipeline** - Comprehensive automated workflow

## Files in this directory:
- `Dockerfile` - Vulnerable Dockerfile using outdated PHP version
- `composer.json` - PHP dependencies with known vulnerabilities
- `trivy-scan.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow for automated scanning
- `cvss-analysis.sh` - Script for CVSS score analysis and prioritization
- `custom-report.tpl` - Custom HTML template for detailed reporting
- `automated-security-pipeline.sh` - Complete automated security assessment script
- `sample-app/` - Sample PHP application files

## Expected Workflow Outputs:
- **JSON Report**: Machine-readable vulnerability data for automation
- **SARIF Report**: Integrated with GitHub Security tab showing vulnerabilities in code context
- **HTML Report**: Human-readable comprehensive report for security teams
- **Executive Summary**: High-level overview for management
- **Prioritization Matrix**: Vulnerabilities categorized by severity and exploitability
- **Remediation Roadmap**: Actionable steps for vulnerability resolution

## Key Benefits:
- Complete visibility into application security posture
- Multiple report formats for different stakeholders
- Automated integration with development workflows
- Risk-based prioritization for efficient remediation
- Compliance-ready documentation and audit trails
